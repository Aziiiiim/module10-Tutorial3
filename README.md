## 3.1. Original code

This is a test run of the Yew WebChat client based on the tutorial.

- Step 1 :

I open a new web window, login as 'Azim', and click “Go Chatting!”.
I join the chat alone:

- Step 2 :

I open a new web window, login as 'Adi', and click “Go Chatting!”.
I join the chat with Azim but I can't see the previous message from Azim because I was not in the chat session yet.
Azim session sees the new user:
